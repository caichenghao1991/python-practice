"""
    database: data persistence, retrieval and management
    relation database(SQL): need accuracy Oracle/ MySQL / MariaDB (similar to MySQL)   (row-column, 2d table)
        one line: a record    one column: attribute
        ACID
        Atomic: All operations in a transaction succeed or every operation is rolled back.
        Consistent: On the completion of a transaction, the database is structurally sound.
        Isolated: Transactions do not contend with one another. Contentious access to data is moderated
            by the database so that transactions appear to run sequentially.
        Durable: The results of applying a transaction are permanent, even in the presence of failures.

    non-relational database (NoSQL): faster flexible. MongoDB, Redis (key-value pair, cache),
        Elasticsearch (search engine)
        BASE
        Basic Availability: The database appears to work most of the time.
        Soft-state: Stores donâ€™t have to be write-consistent, nor do different replicas have to be
            mutually consistent all the time.
        Eventual consistency: Stores exhibit consistency at some later point (e.g., lazily at read time).

    SQL: structured query language
        DDL data definition language:  create  drop  alter
        DML data manipulation language:  select insert delete update    crud
        DCL data control language:   grant  revoke

    # recommend use lower case for table and database name
    # data search result case sensitive or not depends on collate rules during database creation
        # utf8_general_ci not case sensitive,  utf8_bin  is case sensitive
    # database object name better use prefix to distinguish: table, view, index, function, procedure, trigger
    # not recommend use in, not in, distinct. consider use exists, no exists
    select 'x'  #'x'    select 'x' from dual  # 'x'  table dual is unique non exist table
    select 'x' from t_student  # how many row is how many 'x'
    select 'x' from dual where exists (select * from t_student where stu_name like 'Harry%')
        # 'x's if some student name harryxxx
    select emp_name, title from t_emp t1 where exists (select 'x' from t_emp t2 where t1.emp_id=t2.mgr)
    == select distinct emp_name, title from t_emp t1 inner join t_emp t2 where t1.emp_id=t2.mgr
    # in subquery use smaller table compare to the main query
    # avoid use <>  not equal, slow
    # use index on frequent searched item, index help on =, like 'keyword%',
        but not helpful for <>, like '%keyword'
    # index slower insert update delete, faster search. use extra space
